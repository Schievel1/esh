===============
 The esh shell
===============

This is ``esh``, an Unix shell with LISP-like syntax created originally by
Ivan Tkatchev. It could originally be found at ``http://slon.ttk.ru/esh/``
but the site has been down for a long while.

This repository contains an updated version with extra patches that will
compile cleanly in recent Unix systemsâ€”with a focus on GNU/Linux. Pull
requests are welcome!
